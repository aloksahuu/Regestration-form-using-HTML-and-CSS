### Design Choices:

1. Background Image:
   - Incorporated a fixed background image (sky2.jpg) for visual appeal.
   - Ensured responsiveness with `background-size: 100% 100%`.

2. Container Styling:
   - Set container width to 400px for a moderate size.
   - Applied a semi-transparent blue background color (`#74d1ee15`) for a subtle effect.

3. Border and Border Radius:
   - Added a black border with a thickness of 10px for a distinct container boundary.
   - Eliminated border-radius for a sharp and clean container edge.

4. Box Shadow:
   - Included a subtle box shadow for a slight lift effect on the container.

5. Heading Style:
   - Centered and padded the heading ("Registration Info") for emphasis.
   - Applied a sans-serif font family for a modern look.

6. Input Styling:
   - Styled input fields with red borders (`#ed0909`) for visual contrast.
   - Set padding and border-radius for a comfortable and modern input appearance.

7. Button Design:
   - Utilized a dark background color (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.522)`) for the button.
   - Applied a transition effect on hover to enhance interactivity.
   - Changed hover background color to a vibrant blue (`#0face4`).

8. Responsive Design:
   - Implemented a media query for smaller screens (max-width: 700px).
   - Adjusted container width to 90% for better responsiveness.

### Features:

1. Placeholder Text:
   - Added placeholder text in input fields for clear user guidance.

2. Form Validation:
   - Utilized the `required` attribute for basic client-side form validation.

### Challenges:

1. Balancing Background and Content:
   - Ensured the background image did not overpower the form content, maintaining readability.

2. Color Contrast:
   - Maintained a balance between the background color, text, and input field colors for good visibility.

3. Border and Border Radius:
   - Decided on a sharp border without border-radius for a specific design preference.
